[{"content":" ResNet Block # 3x3 Convolution (stride=2) - Downsamples the image into half the height and width. Also, doubles the number of channels (number of filters are doubled). Sliding a 3x3 kernel/matrix onto the image and dot product is calculated with overlapped images. 3x3 is small enough to capture fine details and more efficient. Can be stacked to capture complex patterns. Batch Norm ReLU Thought Process # Our goal is to increase the resolution of the image.\nIf the model is trained on a vanilla deep net with both low and high resolution input images, it will increase our training loss since the input signal is being lost when its passed through a lot of layers.\nOur goal is to now learn the residual to be added to the image to increase its resolution.\nThe idea is to add the input image to our residual at the end of our block. Two problems arise:\nDimension mismatch (When the input and residual have different dimensions, we cannot add) A steady stream of input data across the network So we add residual connections to handle these. And we treat the network as a series of residual blocks instead of layers.\nEach block does not take penalty from the loss function since it can output the same identity function.\nThis enables very deep networks.\nCode # def forward(self, x: Tensor) -\u0026gt; Tensor: identity = x out = self.conv1(x) out = self.bn1(out) out = self.relu(out) out = self.conv2(out) out = self.bn2(out) if self.downsample is not None: identity = self.downsample(x) out += identity out = self.relu(out) return out Resnet18, 34, 50, 101, 152. These are pretrained models and the number indicates the number of layers in the architecture.\nArchitecture # ResNet models introduce the concept of residual learning, where the network learns residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, rather than learning unreferenced functions. This allows the model to train very deep networks effectively.\nUse Cases # ResNet models are commonly used in image classification tasks and are known for their performance on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.\nStrengths and Weaknesses # Strengths: Effective in training very deep networks. Reduces the problem of vanishing gradients. Weaknesses: Computationally expensive for very deep versions like ResNet-152. May not be as efficient for smaller datasets or less complex tasks.

However, its standard implementation can encounter numerical instability when dealing with very large or small logits. This post walks through the implementation of a numerically stable BCE loss function in PyTorch, ensuring robustness during model training.\nMathematical Background # The standard BCE loss for a single sample is defined as:\n$$\\text{BCE}(z, y) = - \\left[ y \\cdot \\log(p) + (1 - y) \\cdot \\log(1 - p) \\right]$$\nwhere \\( p = \\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \\) is the sigmoid of the logit \\( z \\), and \\( y \\) is the true label (0 or 1).\nUnderflow # Direct computation of \\( p \\) can lead to overflow or underflow for large \\( |z| \\). A numerically stable alternative is:\n$$\\text{BCE}(z, y) = \\max(z, 0) - y \\cdot z + \\log(1 + e^{-|z|})$$\nThis formulation avoids computing \\( \\sigma(z) \\) directly, mitigating numerical issues.\nCode # def bce_loss(logits: torch.Tensor, targets: torch.Tensor) -\u0026gt; torch.Tensor: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Numerically stable binary cross-entropy loss. :param logits: Raw model outputs (logits), shape (batch_size,) or (batch_size, 1) :param targets: Ground truth labels (0 or 1), same shape as logits :return: Mean loss over the batch \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Ensure logits are 1D logits = logits.squeeze() # Compute stable BCE: max(logits, 0) - logits * targets + log(1 + exp(-abs(logits))) loss = torch.maximum(logits, torch.zeros_like(logits)) - logits * targets + torch.log1p(torch.exp(-torch.abs(logits))) return loss.mean() The implementation of the BCE loss function is crucial for understanding how to handle numerical stability during training :\nInput Handling: The squeeze() operation ensures logits are a 1D tensor, accommodating varying input shapes.\nStable Computation: The formula leverages torch.maximum and torch.log1p (log(1 + x) for small x) to prevent overflow/underflow.\nBatch Averaging: The mean loss is returned, suitable for optimization. This implementation is critical for training models where logits may vary widely in magnitude, ensuring numerical reliability.\nApplications: Binary classification tasks, including emotion detection, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.\nPerformance Considerations: While this implementation is stable, batch size and input distribution can significantly affect training dynamics.\n","date":"March 5 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/loss-functions/binary-cross-entropy/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Binary Cross-Entropy Loss","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"March 5 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/loss-functions/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Loss Functions","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"March 5 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/supervised-learning/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Supervised Learning","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"February 14 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/classification/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Classification","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"February 14 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/linear-models/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Linear Models","type":"tags"},{"content":" A classification technique which computes the probability or likelihood that the data belongs to a class of interest. $$\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x_n$$\nGoal : Maximize likelihood\nOptimization Method : Gradient Descent\nGenerally fits an ‘S’ curve (‘S’ shaped logistic function) for the data to belong to separate classes.\nBinary Classification # Sigmoid transforms the linear combination of inputs into probability. $$\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$\n\\(z = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x_n\\) The curve which gives the maximum likelihood is selected as the end result.\nMultinomial Logistic Regression # One-vs-Rest (OvR) Classification :\nFor \\(K\\) classes, train \\(K\\) separate binary classifiers (one class vs the rest).

Different binary classifiers may produce overlapping decision regions which may lead to ambiguous classification, especially when classes are imbalanced. Softmax Logistic Function :\nSoftmax ensures the predicted probabilities of all classes sum to 1. $$P(y=k|x)=\\frac{e^{x^T\\beta_{k}}}{\\sum_{j=1}^Ke^{x^T\\beta_{j}}}$$\n\\(x\\) = feature vector \\(K\\) = number of classes \\(\\beta_{k}\\) = parameter vector for class \\(k\\) Provides a coherent probability model.

We apply log transformation to change it into a summation. $$\\ell(\\beta)=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i \\log(p_i) + (1-y_i) \\log(1-p_i))$$ Multi-Classification using Softmax : $$\\ell({\\beta_{k}}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \\log\\left( \\frac{e^{x_i^\\top \\beta_{k}}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{x_i^\\top \\beta_j}} \\right)$$\nAssumptions # An S shaped curve is assumed to fit the data. The independent variable should have strong correlation with the likelihood of the class. Linearity in the Logit : The log-odds (logits) of the outcome are assumed to be a linear combination of the independent variables. $$\\log\\left( \\frac{p}{1-p} \\right)=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}x_{1}+\\dots+\\beta_{n}x_{n}$$ The coefficients are in the log-odds scale. All Linear Regression tests can be done on this line. Independence : Observations are assumed to be independent of each other. No or Little Multicollinearity : The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. A sufficiently large sample is preferred to obtain reliable estimates. Limitations # Linear Decision Boundary in Logit Space : Assuming a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the outcome, might not capture more complex, non-linear relationships. Sensitivity to Outliers : Extreme values can disproportionately affect the model. Multicollinearity : High correlation among independent variables can destabilize coefficient estimates. Feature transformations : For data that is not linearly separable (in the logit domain), performance may suffer unless features are transformed or interaction terms are added. Diagnostic Decision Table # Observation Implication Action Poor Overall Model Fit : High deviance, low pseudo R-squared, or significant lack-of-fit (e.g., failing the Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The model may be mis-specified, missing important predictors, or not capturing the true relationship between variables. Reassess model specification: consider adding relevant predictors, interaction terms, or non-linear transformations. Non-significant Coefficients : Predictors with high p-values or wide confidence intervals. These predictors may not contribute meaningfully to predicting the outcome, possibly diluting the model’s effectiveness. Remove or re-specify insignificant variables, and ensure that only meaningful predictors remain in the model. Low Predictive Performance : Low classification accuracy, poor ROC-AUC, or imbalanced confusion matrix (e.g., high false positives/negatives). The model might be underfitting, failing to capture important data patterns, or struggling with class imbalance. Perform feature engineering, consider re-balancing the dataset, explore alternative model specifications, or try regularization techniques. High Multicollinearity : Indicators such as high Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values or inflated standard errors. Predictor variables are highly correlated, leading to unstable coefficient estimates and difficulty in interpreting their individual effects. Remove, combine, or transform correlated predictors, or apply regularization (L1/L2) to mitigate multicollinearity issues. Influential Observations : A few data points exhibit high Cook’s distance or leverage values. These observations may disproportionately affect model estimates, potentially skewing results and interpretations. Investigate and validate these outliers. Consider robust regression techniques or, if justified, remove problematic observations after careful analysis. Patterned Residuals : Residual plots show systematic patterns or non-random distribution. This suggests that the model is missing key relationships (e.g., interactions or non-linear effects), indicating mis-specification. Consider adding interaction terms, polynomial terms, or applying variable transformations to better capture the underlying data structure. Poor Calibration in Multi-Class Models (OvR approach) : Inconsistent or poorly calibrated predicted probabilities across classes. The individual binary classifiers may not provide directly comparable probabilities, potentially leading to ambiguous class assignments. For multi-class problems, consider switching to multinomial (softmax) logistic regression, applying probability calibration techniques, or using methods to better balance class predictions. Steps # Goal : Maximize likelihood\nModel : \\(\\log\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_n x_n\\)\nCompute the likelihood for each observation. Apply the log transformation to obtain the log-likelihood. Optimize the parameters using Gradient Descent. Calculate evaluation metrics and diagnose. Use Wald’s Test to determine whether a feature is useful in computing the prediction. Validate model assumptions such as linearity and independence.
